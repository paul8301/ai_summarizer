# ai_summarizer
It is a AI webpage/article summarizer that works with the help of GPT to summarize content. The APIs used for this project is RapidAPI which provides AI models free of cost for developers to work with.
The styling is done with the help of Tailwind CSS.
Those who are going to use this code must create a profile on Rapid API and get a key for the article summarizer. I haven't included my key in the code and hence the code may not work for those who directly run it on ypur systems.
